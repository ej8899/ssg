# Static Site Generator

python based static site generator (convert .md files into html pages w recursive directories, templating, etc)

This project is a part of the "Boot.dev" training platform (sign up through my link and we both get a 'mythic chest' -> https://www.boot.dev?bannerlord=ej8899 ).  Although this is a part of this training program, it is a project I've had on my to do list for quite some time - so its been good incentive to get it underway!
